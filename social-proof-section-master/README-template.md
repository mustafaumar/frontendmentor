### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I had some issues with the mobile design. My grid for those names were not in the center. I tried using justify content and align items but it was not working.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped when learning how to use grid templates columns and rows. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
